# *Note*
# This agent check will modify the original graylog2 metric names to be more human friendly,
#   it will replace some name prefixes (e.g. org.graylog2. -> graylog2., org.apache. -> graylog2.apache.)
#   as well as making them Datadog friendly (IndexerSetupService -> indexer_setup_service), and
#   finally to flatten them (a metric value of {"time": {"min": 0, "max": 5}} will produce 2 metrics)

  -
    # URI for the REST api
    transport_uri: http://localhost:12900

    #   To create a new read only user, from the graylog2 web ui: System -> Users -> Add new user
    # username: username
    # password: password

    # **recommended**
    # Graylog2 has ALOT of available metrics once resolved (thousands of them)
    # You can use the two below options to limit which metrics are included or excluded,
    #   for each original metric name, this agent will check if any of the defined prefixes
    #   matches for that metric, which will then include or exclude that metric depending on
    #   which list the prefix is defined in
    #
    # For a list of available metric names you can fetch the following from the API:
    #   http://127.0.0.1:12900/cluster/<node-id>/metrics/names
    # Or use the `Clister/Metrics` endpoints from the REST API Browser at:
    #   http://127.0.0.1:12900/api-browser
    #
    # Omit all metrics with the following prefixes
    # prefix_blacklist:
    #   - org.graylog2.rest.resources.tools.
    #   - org.graylog2.dashboards.
    #
    # Include *only* the metrics will the following prefixes
    # prefix_whitelist:
    #   - jvm.
    #   - org.graylog2.rest.
    #   - org.graylog2.system.
